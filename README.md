Project Description: Weather App

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to retrieve and display weather information for a specific city. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will fetch current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provide details such as temperature and weather description.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter the city name and view the weather information.

Real-time weather data: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API in real-time, ensuring that users receive up-to-date weather information.
Dynamic content: The weather information is dynamically displayed on the same page without the need for page reload, providing a smooth user experience.

Responsive design: The app is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
Developer information: The footer section of the app displays information about the creator, including their name and links to their LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: Used for structuring the web page and defining its content.
CSS3: Applied styles to create an attractive and visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Handled form submission and dynamically updated the weather information on the page.
Express.js: Utilized to handle server-side operations, such as serving static files and handling form submissions.
OpenWeatherMap API: Integrated to fetch weather data based on the user's inputted city name.
This project is a great way to practice web development skills, including working with APIs, handling form submissions, and dynamically updating content on a web page. It provides an opportunity to showcase your abilities in creating responsive and interactive web applications.
